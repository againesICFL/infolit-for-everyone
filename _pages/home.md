"Information overload." "Fake news." The wild, wild west that is the Internet. Now more than ever, information literacy is a crucial life skill.  

Library workers are uniquely positioned to instill and foster the information literacy skill set. But we must first cultivate it ourselves. As members of the Idaho library and education communities with backgrounds in public, academic, and special libraries, we've created this resource in hopes of making information literacy concepts and instruction materials more accessible for the widest range of library workers and patrons.  

Built around an introduction to the [SIFT Moves]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/sift/) model for information literacy, this site encourages you to check sources efficiently, not deeply. We plan to add additional applications of the SIFT moves in the future, so keep an eye on this space!  

When you'd like to learn more about SIFT, we encourage you to read Caulfield's [Check, Please! Starter Course](https://www.notion.so/Check-Please-Starter-Course-ae34d043575e42828dc2964437ea4eed) for further more tools and explanations. You can also read [his initial, briefer explanation of the moves](https://hapgood.us/2019/06/19/sift-the-four-moves/) on his site.
