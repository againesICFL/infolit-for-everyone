## Project Team  

We're a group of Idaho library workers intent on making information literacy accessible through OERs (open educational resources). You can follow along with—or even contribute to—the development of this project on [our team page at the Rebus Community Open Textbook Directory](https://www1.rebus.community/#/project/379f6355-8f50-4b7f-9408-ab88cb3eafd5) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/infolit-idaho/infolit-for-everyone) .  

## Version Information  

This is version 0.9.0 of this resource—a version we are happy to share publicly while still refining some rough edges.  

We will document any notable changes to this project in our [changelog](/CHANGELOG). We also will use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). We encourage OER practitioners to adopt similar practices in detailing the changes in their resources, whether with these models or new ones more suited to OER. To that end, we're also detailing a few facets we'd like to see become standard in the descriptions of other OER projects.  

5Ps of this work:  

- Primary Intended Audience: Public library workers  
- Potential Additional Audiences: Any library workers; patrons  
- Purpose: Introducing an emerging information literacy model (SIFT) to public library workers, plus eventually applying that model to specific domains, such as health/medical information or privacy  
- Planned: Additional modules that apply information literacy to specific domains, such as health information literacy or privacy & data collection as information literacy  
- Provenance: This is the initial OER, not an adaptation of another work. (Although conceptually this work profoundly revolves around Caulfield's SIFT Moves model and resources.)
