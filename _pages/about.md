"Information overload." "Fake news." The wild, wild west that is the Internet. Now more than ever, information literacy in the 21st century is a crucial life skill.  

Library workers are uniquely positioned to instill and foster the information literacy skill set. But we must first cultivate it ourselves. To this end, we, members of the Idaho library and education communities with backgrounds in public, academic, and special libraries, have embarked on this project to make understanding and teaching information literacy an accessible undertaking for library workers and patrons of varying backgrounds and specializations.  

We hope you will undertake this journey with us, and have fun doing it!  

## Project Team  

We're a group of Idaho library workers intent on making information literacy accessible through OERs (open educational resources). You can follow along with—or even contribute to—the development of this project on [our team page at the Rebus Community Open Textbook Directory](https://www1.rebus.community/#/project/379f6355-8f50-4b7f-9408-ab88cb3eafd5).
