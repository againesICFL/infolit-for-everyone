It sounds counterintuitive, but this model suggests that when you first find a source, you **don't** start by reading it. Why waste even a couple minutes reading garbage when you could just avoid engaging to begin with? So instead of jumping right into the content of what you find, try to place it in context.  

Ask yourself, "What's the platform or publisher behind this article, book, blog post, etc.? Who wrote this work? What's the reputation of the site, publisher, or social media network?" If you don't already know those details, don't engage with it until you've found the answers.  

Returning to our "learning to drive" analogy, you've probably developed the habit of looking over your shoulder before changing lanes. You know that shouldn't impulsively act—you first need to be aware of what is over there. Awareness of context goes for what you read as well, even if the consequences aren't as immediate.  

This basic behavior of gaining context first goes not just for a single source, but also for when using search engines. Instead of clicking right away on the top result, spend 10 or 15 seconds scanning the results. You'll often see titles, source descriptions, section headings that group results into particular categories, and other contextual cues, all right there. Stanford's History Education Group calls this short pause "click restraint" when they discuss lateral reading… which is one of the best ways to do the next move: investigating the source.
