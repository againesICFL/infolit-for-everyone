SIFT highly suggests looking beyond the initial source. Instead of getting overwhelmed by the difficulties of information evaluation, you can use the abundance of information sources to your advantage. Don't waste time on just any glittery, sparkly thing—keep sifting through sources until you find something that seems likely to be a real gem.  

How will you know it's a gem? Of course, there are strategies for evaluating things in further depth as well. Stanford's Civic Online Reasoning is one of the quickest. It asks: 
1. Who's behind the information?  
2. What's the evidence?  
3. What do other sources say?  

You've probably already noticed that point 1 sounds a lot like "investigate the source" and point 3 sounds a lot like "find better coverage." That part in the middle—"what's the evidence?"—can take a very long time to decipher, depending on the source. Sources use a wide range of types of evidence—just think of how different the evidence would be for a scientific argument about how magnets work and a humanities argument about why video games can act as a modern form of art! Even if you're just talking about evidence around "who, when, what, where, how, and why", journalistic evidence and historical evidence would approach those questions in different ways. The better we get at recognizing different types of information, the better we get at learning to evaluate them.  

This also goes for recognizing the goals, or purpose, each source has for sharing information. If we realize that we're engaging with a satirical source like the Onion, the Daily Show, or even an old George Carlin stand-up recording, we'll realize that their purpose is to entertain us or to see something in a new light. This isn't a difficulty for the internet alone. As embarrassing as it is, I can still remember becoming truly angry when I read Jonathan Swift's [A Modest Proposal]() in high school, since I didn't stop to look at the top of the page in our textbook. The running chapter heading would have quickly told me that this was the first reading in our new chapter: satire.  

One common model for evaluating sources the acronym "CRAAP." It aims to reminds you to consider whether a source is current, reliable, accurate, authoritative, and pertinent. These are all important facets to consider when selecting a source. But research increasingly shows that students taught to evaluate using this model don't use it reliably. <!-- do more about why it's not a test, also link to Stanford COR, Caulfield, and other sources on CRAAP --> 

<!-- Add New Literacy's question about "what is this source trying to do," and maybe introduce the idea of source genres / genre literacy -->
