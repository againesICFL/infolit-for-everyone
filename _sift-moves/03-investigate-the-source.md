So how do we establish context about a source? How can you tell whether the article you're reading about the health properties of sugar beets is written by a well-known nutritionist or is actually "sponsored" (i.e. paid-to-place) content written by the advertising wing of a sugar beet company?  

One of the quickest and most reliable ways is to practice click restraint. Don't even immediately click on the "About Page"â€”although that page can often be helpful! Instead, search for the author, publication, or site on Wikipedia. Wikipedia has downsides, of course. But since it's crowdsourced, its contents are continually being corrected, expanded, and otherwise improved. It's a quick way to check whether a person or publication is considered notable enough for an entry.  

This "notability" decision can be tricky, unfortunately. Wikipedia is often critiqued for having biases against creating standalone entries for people who are minorities, women, and/or professors. It also is far less likely to have entries for rural authors and subjects. So if there is an entry, the contents of that entry can help you evaluate the source more quickly. But if there isn't an entry, you'll probably want to think about why that might be instead of immediately deciding that the subject isn't worthwhile at all.  

If there is an entry for the person, publication, or other source, you don't have to read the whole thing. You can skim the first section, then the titles of any other sections, looking for praise and awards as well as for controversies or red flags. Using your web browser's built-in "find on this page" tool can make this skimming even faster.
