# Information Literacy for Everyone  

"Information overload." "Fake news." The wild, wild west that is the Internet. Now more than ever, information literacy is a crucial life skill.  

Library workers are uniquely positioned to instill and foster the information literacy skill set. But we must first cultivate it ourselves. As members of the Idaho library and education communities with backgrounds in public, academic, and special libraries, we've created this resource in hopes of making information literacy concepts and instruction materials more accessible for the widest range of library workers and patrons.  

## Project Team  

We're a group of Idaho library workers intent on making information literacy accessible through OERs (open educational resources). You can follow along with—or even contribute to—the development of this project on [our team page at the Rebus Community Open Textbook Directory](https://www1.rebus.community/#/project/379f6355-8f50-4b7f-9408-ab88cb3eafd5).
